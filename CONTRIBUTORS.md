### How to become a Committer?

Committers are Contributors who have earned the ability to modify (“commit”) source code, documentation or other technical artifacts in a project’s repository.
Existing Committers are able to nominate new Committers, and the existing Committers will vote on the nomination (majority approval is required).

> NOTE:
> Please note that a Committer may be removed by a majority approval of the other existing Committers.
